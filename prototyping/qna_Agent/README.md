# Setting up OpenAI API Key

To get started, you'll need to set up your OpenAI API key. This key is essential for interacting with OpenAI's powerful language models.
## Step 1: Create a .env file

In order to keep your API key secure and separate from your code, we'll use a .env file. This file is used to store environment variables, including sensitive information like API keys.

    Create a new file named .env in the root directory of your project.

## Step 2: Add your OpenAI API key

create the .env file in a text editor and add the following line:

plaintext

OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

Replace "your_api_key_here" with your actual OpenAI API key. Make sure not to include any extra spaces or characters.
## Step 3: Save the file

Save the .env file.
