The SingularityNET daemon is an adapter that allows AI services to interface with the SingularityNET platform. The daemon handles tasks such as payment processing and request translation. The SingularityNET SDK provides tools for developers to integrate their services with the platform. The Multi-Party Escrow contract enables secure and efficient payments between consumers and service providers. The SingularityNET Marketplace is a decentralized application that lists and facilitates interactions with AI services. The marketplace integrates with the Multi-Party Escrow and allows users to rate and review services."

It handles payment, service ratings, and integrates with the SingularityNET curation service. The Marketplace is curated by the SingularityNET Foundation and is currently in beta. Users can call services through the Marketplace by installing an Ethereum browser extension like MetaMask. The Marketplace has requirements for service authors to ensure their services are visible to others. SingularityNET supports multiple programming languages and AI frameworks. The Developer Portal provides documentation and guidelines for writing and integrating new AI services. The SingularityNET Developer Portal Theme is a Jekyll theme for project documentation. Users can contribute to SingularityNET by submitting issues, bug reports, or feature requests. The platform can be deployed on GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages. The configuration file (_config.yml) contains various settings for customization, including color themes, logos, navigation, footer, Google Analytics, Disqus comments, and favicon."
